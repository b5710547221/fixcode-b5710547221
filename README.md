## Code Improvement Exercise

1. Clone this repository from Github to your computer.
2. Make improvements to the class src/fixcode/polymath.java. 
3. Commit your changes to your local git repository. Note that you need to rename `polymath.java` to use the Java Naming Convention.  So you must tell git that the file has been renamed using `git mv`:
    ```shell
    cmd>  git mv src/fixcode/polymath.java src/fixcode/NewName.java
    cmd>  git commit -a -m "describe what you did"
    ```
4. Push your work to Github.

### What to Change

1. There are "TODO" comments in the code describing what to do.
2. You must implement some methods: `getIntReply`, `findMin`, and `polyval`.
3. You may add other methods, too.
